# The Odin Project: Todo List Project

## Thoughts

## Learnings
- I will need to confirm this with further testing but I have learnt that you can export and import a function
and gain access to any other functions that the imported function calls; like gaining access to a specific point
of a hierarchy tree and all its branches (I need to come up with a better way to explain this).
- **overflow-y: auto;** enables a vertical scrollbar when the content exceeds the specified height.
- **grid-template-rows: repeat(auto-fill, 6%);** sets the explicit rows to have a height of 6% and uses auto-fill to create as many rows as needed based on the content.
- **grid-auto-rows: 6%;** sets the height for any additional rows that are created implicitly (dynamically added) to also be 6%.
  - This way, both explicit and implicit rows will have a height of 6%. Adjust the values and other styles according to your specific layout requirements.

## Recapping
- Setting active and inactive elements by the addition and removal of a class name

## WIP
- Get the logic working for projects:
- deleting a project
- renaming a project
