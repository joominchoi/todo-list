## Thoughts

## Learnings
- I will need to confirm this with further testing but I have learnt that you can export and import a function
and gain access to any other functions that the imported function calls; like gaining access to a specific point
of a hierarchy tree and all its branches (I need to come up with a better way to explain this).

## Recapping
- Setting active and inactive elements by the addition and removal of a class name
